# What it can do

Yes, I'm obsessive with clean names for my MP3 files and deeply troubled by the messy and unreadable strings hanging there. If you share the same feelings, this little program can do the following work: changing the name of MP3 file to the format of " artist - title.mp3".

The program can work with "utf-8", which means it can handle both English and Asian characters, such as Chinese.


# How it works

Put the MP3 files that you want to rename in the "workspace" folder. Run the Python script. Make a cup of tea and wait for a while.
